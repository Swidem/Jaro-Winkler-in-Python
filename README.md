# Jaro-Winkler alghoritm in Python

While using the book "Pan Tadeusz" in txt format, I am performing the following tasks:

1. Splitting the text from the file to write one word per line, while eliminating words from the stoplist.
2. Creating a new file with 50 randomly selected words and another file with modified words.
3. Calculating the Jaro-Winkler Similarity by comparing words from the well-written words file to the file with modifications.
4. Developing a process to extract and compare words from our text file to those used in the correct50words.txt file, based on a specified similarity level (alpha).
