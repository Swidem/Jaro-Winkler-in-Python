# Jaro-Winkler alghoritm in Python

While using the book „Pan Tadusz” in txt format I am doing these tasks:

1.    Splitting text form file to write one word per line and eliminating stoplist

2.    Creating new file with 50 words and the second one with modifications in words.

3.    Creating Jaro-Winkler Similarity comparing words from file with well-written words to the second one with modifications.

4.    Building process which will extract compared words from out text file to those used in file corrections.txt for our similarity level (alpha).
